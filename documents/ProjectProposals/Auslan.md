# Auslan Translation with Real Time Pose Estimation

## Problem Statement
* Mute or deaf people are excluded from conversations from people who do not know sign language.    
* There are no portable and accessible solutions for the general population.    
    - Proprietary products only available + non accessible  
    - Current projects focus on ASL (American sign language), but not Auslan  
    - Example 1: http://blog.leapmotion.com/giving-deaf-people-a-voice-motionsavvys-real-time-sign-language-translation/  
    - Example 2: https://www.kintrans.com/  
    - There are probably a couple more projects that are on sign   language translation, please post it here if you can find more.  

## Project Summary
* We want to provide an accessible communication platform for people with disabilities to interact.  
* Build an application either on laptop or mobile that does real time pose estimation that translates poses/gestures into text and ultimately to speech.  

## Pros + Cons

### Pros
* The motivation is “meaningful”
* The goal is well-defined
* Good for showcase (Endeavour) purpose

### Cons
* Signs are not always clear cut -- think spoken english, words and syllables could be lumped together.  
* We need to track poses over a period of time to determine one word (more processing needed to get a word).
