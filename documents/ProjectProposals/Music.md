# Music Gesture Interaction with Real Time Pose Estimation

## Problem Statement
* No widely accessible platform to incorporate gesture into digital music
* Especially for musicians as they are not technical

## Project Summary
* We want to build a system revolving music control around human actions
* We want to make it accessible and simple for the wider music community

## Pros + Cons

### Pros
* Difficulty is adjustable in terms of gesture recognition.    
* Since we can decide how to map the gestures to musical parameters, we can adjust the mapping strategy as we see fit.    
* Good for showcase (Endeavour) purpose.    

### Cons
* Project goal is (well-)defined, but ambiguity lies in how we map gestures in a way that is musically meaningful.  
* Some mapping strategies: https://research.gold.ac.uk/6834/1/P88_Tanaka.pdf.    
* Another mapping strategy: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2765549_Instrumental_Gestural_Mapping_Strategies_as_Expressivity_Determinants_in_Computer_Music_Performance  
* The motivation is less noble compared to real-time Auslan translation -- this is more like a “hobby project”.
