# Music Gesture Control with Real Time Pose Estimation

## Problem Statement
* Musicians are often limited by traditional instruments and are limited by its physical capabilities.
* No widely accessible platform to incorporate gesture into music.
* Especially for musicians as they are not technical

## Project Summary
*  We aim to build an interactive music system that liberates musicians from physical limitations. 
* To build a system revolving music control around human actions.
* To make it accessible and simple for the wider music community.
* To showcase the application possibilities using pose estimation.

## Objectives
* __TODO__: look at the assignment requirements and maybe revisit the headings later.
* To develop an effective mapping strategy: To map the gestures to musical parameters.
* To resolve the ambiguities in how we map the gestures in a way that is musically meaningful.

* To design a user-control platform which allows the users to map their own defined gestures, if possible.
* __DESIRED_OUTCOMES__:
    - The videos linked below are something we aim to achieve only through RGB cameras,
instead of dedicated hardware.
