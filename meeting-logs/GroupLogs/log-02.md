# Team Meeting Log
* Semester - 01
* Week - 02
* Date - 13 march, 2020
* Time - 10am - 1230 pm

## Attendees
* Tsz Kiu
* Matthew Yong
* Yong Yick

## Discussion Items
* Dicussing project proposal ideas from each group member. 
* Decided on two main project proposals, proposed by Tsz Kiu.  
* Discussed project proposal with framework:
    - Problem Statement: Problem that project aims to solve.  
    - Project Objectives: How is the project going to solve it?  
    - Project Timeline of Milestones: How is project progress going to be seen or measured?  

### Project Proposals
#### Auslan Translation via Real Time Pose Estimation
* Creating a system that translates sign language poses into speech.  
* Can be realized as an application that people can use freely.  
* Created document on formalizing project proposal.  
* Feedback on this project:
    - Steep learning curve in learning machine learning + sign language.    
    - Gesture recognition is achievable but sign language part could be not as clear cut.   
    - Something relatable to people.  
    - Not sure if we have enough time to do both machine learning + sign language recognitions.  
    - Not sure if we have enough datasets for sign language.  
    - Focus more on software, which can be easily redesigned or reimplemented as compared to a hardware focussed solution.   
    - Can further implement or extend software implementation using hardware and building GUI/application.  
    - Can run in parallel, each group memeber does different task.  
#### Music Gesture Control via Real Time Pose Estimation
* Creating a system that uses body gesture recognition to control musical paramerters.  
* Parameters such as volume, tone, pitch and more.   
* Feedback given somewhat similar to Auslan project. 
* Differences:
    - Music gesture control can be relative, no objective gestures to control music.  
    - Easier on the results end, using open source software to create musical tones or to change muscical parameters.  
    ( no need for machine learning here ).  

## Responsibilities/Action Items
* Formalizing project proposals via Google Docs to markdown files ( due Tuesday 17 March ). 
* Doing simple research on knowing how to run open pose on local machine.
