## Discussions
1. Jonathan's team expectation - pass
2. research-based vs implementation based?
	1. implementation;
		* to take the endeavour exhibition into account, a typical capstone is more of an implementation-based;
		* main focus: to apply/solve certain problem(s); 
			* open-ended applications, e.g. tennis-player movement tracking-and-inference;
		* ideally, first, to come up with specs, then build-test-iterative w.r.t the specs;
	2. research; two approaches;
		1. improving (?) existing model and compare it with existing models with respect to sepcs/criteria
		2. drastic: to come up with a novel solution
		* main focus: quantitative (rigorous) analysis on how well it performs; 
		* still need to have some application to showcase, but not primary;
	3. the choice depends on individual's future direction/aligned interest; enjoyable? project feasibility?
3. communication style
	1. email for prompt response;
	2. meeting otherwise: fortnighly meeting; Friday; 530 pm; Jonathan's place;
	3. Jonathan has the access to team's github repo;
4. suggestions on project management tools: whichever is convenient;
5. resources: ieee on signal/image processing, computer vision; internet;
6. work-style: to identify which style suits the team: sprint-style?
7. workflow: explore -> build -> test -> fix --iterative -- -> report;
8. formal project-timeline? expected to have for a capstone team;


## Action Items
1. to have a well-defined scope for the project in two weeks starting from 6 march, 2020;
