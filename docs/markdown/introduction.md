### Introduction

##### Disclaimer

This project is only developed as a **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** system. It should not be interpreted as a product for commerical or real-world application. The gestures selected to demonstrate our application are adapted from the Australian Sign Language (Auslan). 
However, we **do not** claim to be represent the Auslan Community.

This is the technical documentation of the project **"Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning"**. The documentation will cover the following aspects of our project:

* Overview:
  * Quick overview on the context of our project.
* Features:
  * High level view of our project features.
* Human Pose Estimation:
  * Performing Human Pose Estimation using OpenPose.
* Dataset Processing:
  * How we processed, stored and augmented our data for our deep learning model.
* Background:
  * Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory Networks.
* Model Development:
  * How we developed our model, a sign language recognition model.
* Further Improvements:
  * How we optimized and improved our model's performance. 
* Application Deployment:
  * How we deployed our system as both a desktop and web application.
