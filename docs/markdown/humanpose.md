### Human Pose Estimation

[Work in Progress]

* We used [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), an open source Real Time multi Human Pose Detection software.
* Developed and maintained by a group of computer science researchers from Carnegie Mellon University.
  * Authored by Gines Hidalgo, Zhe Cao, Tomas Simon, Shih-En Wei, Hanbyul Joo, and Yaser Sheikh. 
  * Maintained by Gines Hidalgo and Yaadhav Raaj.
* We utilised OpenPose to extract out the following human keypoints:
  * 7 Skeleton Pose Keypoints
  * 21 Keypoints from Right Hand
  * 21 Keypoints from Left Hand
